                            <p class="mt-3">Cavan was founded by the Irish clan chief and Lord of East Breifne, Giolla Íosa Ruadh O’Reilly, between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a friary run by the Dominican Order was established close to the O’Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town's marketplace. It is recorded that the (Cavan) Dominicans were expelled in 1393, replaced by an Order of Conventual Franciscan friars. The friary's location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">King James I granted the town a charter in 1610. This also entitled Cavan town to send two members to the Irish parliament. In February 1690, see Glorious Revolution, the Battle of Cavan took place after Williamite Inniskillinger forces led by Colonel William Wolseley attacked the strategic fort overlooking Cavan town at Tullamongan which was held then by the Duke of Berwick Jacobite army. During the battle much of the town was burned by Colonel Wolseley's soldiers and Jacobite general William Nugent was killed.[3] Later, during the 18th century, local administrative influence and power passed to the Maxwell family, descendants of Robert Maxwell, Church of Ireland Bishop of Kilmore (1643–1672), a family who later entered the peerage as Baron Farnham.

                                Farnham House, located at Farnham, a small rural district to the north-west of Cavan, is one of the largest country houses in the county. It was built for Barry Maxwell, 3rd Lord Farnham (later created, by the second creation, Earl of Farnham), head of the Maxwell dynasty, around 1780. The house was designed by James Wyatt. It was extended in 1810 to the design of Francis Johnston, a County Armagh-born, but Dublin-based, architect. It was sold by Diana, Lady Farnham (widow of Barry Maxwell, 12th Lord Farnham), to a local entrepreneur[when?], and the house and estate has per 2006[4][5] been converted into a luxury hotel and leisure complex under the Radisson SAS international hotel group.
                                
                                Developments in Cavan during the early 19th century saw the building of a new wide street that still bears the name 'Farnham Street'. This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as Cavan Courthouse which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) and those of the Great Northern Railway (GNR). The Town Hall was built in 1908–1909.</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">In 1938, work began on the Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim, the original Kilmore cathedral was built c.1455, as the main church of the Catholic Diocese of Kilmore located around five kilometres (3 mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the R198. During the Plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century, this church became the main Church of Ireland Kilmore Diocese church known as St. Feidhlimidh Cathedral. A new Kilmore Cathedral church was built in 1860 and dedicated to the memory of Bishop William Bedell who died and was buried here in 1642. Bedell was also famously noted for his translation of the old testament Bible into the Irish language. The present Cathedral contains a Hiberno Romanesque doorway dating from c.1170, in the twelfth century, conjectured locally (but unlikely) originally to have come from Holy Trinity priory located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in Lough Oughter. Holy Trinity priory was built mid-thirteenth century. A short distance from the Kilmore Cathedral is the See House, a late Georgian-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by William Farrell, was formerly the official residence (or "Bishop's Palace") of the Church of Ireland Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.

                                On 23 February 1943, a fire at St Joseph's Orphanage in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A public inquiry found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day.[6] The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O'Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer Flann O'Brien. He certainly felt that the commission had not found the truth.

                        <p> The former Cavan Town Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after Sir Roger Casement) and Abbey Street. The current Garda Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.

                                Adjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned bog oak sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on Gulliver's Travels enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to Jonathan Swift and to Cavan where Gulliver's Travels was written.

                                In the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is one of the main economic hubs of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises.
